# Web3 AI Agents – 2-Min Video Pack

Purpose: assets and script for a <3 min video that hits Capstone requirements (problem, why agents, architecture, demo, build). Keep runtime ≈2:00.

## What to cover (checklist)
- Problem: fragmented Web3 data, overload, risk blind spots.
- Why agents: specialized roles + coordination beats one big model.
- Architecture: Orchestrator + Search/DataEng/Analytics/Risk/Trading (+ Evaluator); Gemini, A2A, MCP, memory, human-in-loop.
- Demo: terminal run + report snippet + (optional) approval pause.
- Build: stack (Python + google-adk + Gemini), tools (Binance public data toggle), human-in-loop, eval, deployment idea.

## Files
- `script.md` — 2-min voiceover script with scenes.
- `shots.md` — shot list / overlays and prompts for visuals.

## How to assemble
1) Generate visuals from the prompts (thumbnail/backgrounds), place into `video_assets/`.
2) Record screen snippets (terminal run, report view) if desired.
3) Edit in your NLE/Canva: drop visuals, add voiceover per `script.md`, keep total ≈2:00.
