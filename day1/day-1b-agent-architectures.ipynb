Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Here is a blog outline on the benefits of multi-agent systems for software developers:\n\n## Headline: Unleash Your Development Superpowers: Why Multi-Agent Systems are Your Next Game-Changer\n\n**Introduction Hook:** Feeling overwhelmed by complex software projects? Juggling too many tasks and seeing bugs creep in? What if there was a way to break down your development process into a team of intelligent, specialized \"workers\" that collaborate to build your software more efficiently and robustly? Welcome to the world of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a paradigm shift that's empowering developers like you to achieve more.\n\n---\n\n### Main Section 1: Enhanced Modularity and Maintainability\n\n*   **Divide and Conquer Complexity:** MAS naturally breaks down large, monolithic applications into smaller, independent, and self-contained agents. This makes understanding, debugging, and modifying specific parts of the system significantly easier.\n*   **Reduced Interdependencies:** Each agent operates with its own goals and logic, minimizing direct dependencies on other parts of the system. This isolation allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of agents, leading to faster iteration cycles.\n*   **Simplified Debugging and Testing:** Instead of tracking down bugs in a sprawling codebase, you can pinpoint issues within specific agents. This targeted approach drastically reduces debugging time and makes writing comprehensive unit and integration tests more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### Main Section 2: Improved Scalability and Resilience\n\n*   **On-Demand Resource Allocation:** Agents can be designed to scale independently based on demand. If a particular function of your software experiences a surge in usage, you can spin up more agents for that specific task without affecting other parts of the system.\n*   **Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation:** If one agent fails, the rest of the system can continue to operate, albeit potentially with reduced functionality. MAS promotes graceful degradation, preventing catastrophic system failures and providing a more reliable user experience.\n*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Agents can be added, removed, or reconfigured dynamically at runtime without requiring a full system restart. This agility allows your software to adapt to changing conditions and requirements more effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Main Section 3: Advanced Problem-Solving Capabilities\n\n*   **Specialized Expertise within Agents:** Each agent can be designed with specific expertise, handling particular tasks or domain knowledge. This allows for more efficient and accurate problem-solving as each agent is optimized for its role.\n*   **Collaborative Intelligence and Emergent Behavior:** Agents can communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve complex goals that a single agent or a traditional monolithic system might struggle with. This collaboration can lead to emergent behaviors and solutions that weren't explicitly programmed.\n*   **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Agents can make decisions and take actions autonomously based on their perception of the environment and their goals. This is particularly powerful for applications requiring real-time responses or complex adaptive behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Embracing Multi-Agent Systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about fundamentally changing how you approach software development. By leveraging the power of collaboration, specialization, and autonomy, you can build more robust, scalable, and intelligent applications, ultimately becoming a more efficient and effective software developer. The future of software development is collaborative, and MAS is leading the charge.\nWriterAgent > ## Unleash Your Development Superpowers: Why Multi-Agent Systems are Your Next Game-Changer\n\nFeeling buried under complex projects and the inevitable bugs that follow? Imagine your development process as a well-coordinated team, where specialized \"workers\" collaborate to build software faster and more reliably. This is the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a transformative approach that can significantly boost your development prowess.\n\nOne of the most immediate benefits of MAS is **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. MAS naturally breaks down daunting applications into smaller, independent agents. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy means you can understand, debug, and modify specific parts of your system with far less effort. With reduced interdependencies, agents operate more autonomously, allowing for independent development and faster iteration cycles. Debugging becomes a breeze when you can isolate issues to specific agents rather than sifting through a monolithic codebase.\n\nBeyond ease of management, MAS offers superior **scalability and resilience**. Need to handle a surge in user traffic for a specific feature? You can scale up the relevant agents on demand without impacting the rest of your system. Should one agent encounter an issue, the system can continue to function, exhibiting graceful degradation rather than a catastrophic failure. This fault tolerance, coupled with the ability to dynamically reconfigure agents at runtime, makes your software far more adaptable and robust.\n\nFinally, MAS unlocks **advanced problem-solving capabilities**. Each agent can possess specialized expertise, tackling tasks with optimized efficiency. More importantly, these agents can communicate and collaborate, achieving complex goals through collective intelligence and even emergent behaviors. Their autonomous decision-making empowers applications with real-time responsiveness and sophisticated adaptive logic.\n\nAdopting MAS is more than just a technical choice; it's a strategic shift towards building more intelligent, resilient, and scalable software. By embracing collaboration, specialization, and autonomy, you're not just improving your codebase – you're upgrading your entire development workflow.\nEditorAgent > ## Unleash Your Development Superpowers: Why Multi-Agent Systems are Your Next Game-Changer\n\nFeeling buried under complex projects and the inevitable bugs that follow?

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T16:09:30.245216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T16:09:30.245918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T16:09:30.253096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T16:09:30.245890Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T16:09:30.252198Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.
