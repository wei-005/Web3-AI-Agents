Drug discovery is one of the most active and promising areas for AI in healthcare. There are constant new developments, and the pace of innovation is accelerating.\n\nHere are some of the key areas where we're seeing significant advancements and \"new developments\" (even if the underlying research has been ongoing for a while, the breakthroughs and applications are becoming more tangible):\n\n**1. Accelerating Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI for Genomics and Proteomics:** AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel biological targets (genes or proteins) that play a critical role in disease pathways. This was traditionally a very time-consuming and labor-intensive process.\n    *   **New developments:** Increasingly sophisticated machine learning models that can integrate multi-omics data, identify causal relationships, and predict the \"druggability\" of a target.\n*   **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:** AI can \"read\" millions of scientific papers and databases to extract relationships between genes, diseases, and existing drugs, uncovering hidden connections and suggesting new therapeutic hypotheses.\n    *   **New developments:** Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that can understand complex scientific language and build intricate knowledge graphs to guide research.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation:**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models (GANs, VAEs, Transformers):** These models can learn the chemical properties of existing drugs and then generate entirely new molecular structures with desired characteristics, such as binding affinity to a target, solubility, and low toxicity.\n    *   **New developments:** AI platforms are now capable of designing molecules that have never been synthesized before, optimizing them against multiple parameters simultaneously. Companies are reporting designing compounds that are then moving rapidly into preclinical testing.\n*   **Inverse Design:** Instead of starting with a molecule and testing its properties, AI can start with desired properties and design the molecule to match.\n\n**3. Predicting Drug Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics (PK/PD):**\n\n*   **In Silico ADMET Prediction:** AI models are trained on experimental data to predict how a drug will be Absorbed, Distributed, Metabolized, Excreted, and its Toxicity (ADMET) *before* it's even synthesized or tested in animals. This significantly reduces the failure rate in later stages.\n    *   **New developments:** More accurate and nuanced predictions, especially for complex toxicity endpoints.\n*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** AI is being used to analyze historical clinical trial data, patient characteristics, and preclinical results to better predict the likelihood of success for a drug candidate in human trials.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **AI-Driven Drug Repositioning:** AI can sift through data on approved drugs and their known mechanisms of action to identify potential new uses for existing medications. This is a much faster and cheaper route to new therapies.\n    *   **New developments:** Successful examples are emerging where AI has identified existing drugs for new indications, moving them through clinical trials more rapidly.\n\n**5. Optimizing Synthesis Pathways:**\n\n*   **AI for Chemistry:** AI can help chemists design efficient and scalable synthesis routes for new drug molecules, saving time and resources in the manufacturing process.\n\n**Examples of Recent Progress (Illustrative, not exhaustive):**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-powered drug discovery platform, they have been advancing several AI-designed drugs into clinical trials for indications like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cancer.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to analyze vast biological datasets and identify new drug candidates and targets for various diseases.\n*   **Exscientia:** A leader in AI-driven drug design, they have collaborated with major pharmaceutical companies to bring AI-designed molecules into clinical development.\n*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, predicting how well small molecules will bind to target proteins.\n\n**The Impact:**\n\nThe overarching theme is **speed and efficiency**. AI is dramatically shortening the timelines for certain stages of drug discovery and development, reducing costs, and increasing the probability of success. This means potentially bringing life-saving treatments to patients faster than ever before.\n\nWhile there are still many challenges (e.g., experimental validation remains crucial, regulatory hurdles exist), the progress in AI for drug discovery is one of the most exciting frontiers in modern medicine.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second development I mentioned in my previous response about AI in drug discovery, which was:\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation:**\n\nThis area is incredibly exciting because it's not just about finding existing molecules or modifying them; it's about creating entirely **new** molecular structures that have never existed before, tailored to specific therapeutic needs.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this entails and why it's a significant development:\n\n**What is \"De Novo\" Drug Design?**\n\n*   **\"De Novo\"** is a Latin phrase meaning \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\"\n*   In the context of drug discovery, de novo design means using computational methods, particularly AI, to generate novel molecular structures that are predicted to have desirable therapeutic properties.\n*   This contrasts with traditional approaches like:\n    *   **High-throughput screening (HTS):** Testing large libraries of existing compounds to see if any have activity against a target.\n    *   **Lead optimization:** Taking a promising compound (a \"lead\") and making chemical modifications to improve its properties.\n\n**How AI Enables De Novo Design:**\n\nAI, especially **generative AI models**, is the key driver here. These models learn the underlying rules and patterns of chemistry from vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. Once trained, they can then generate new molecules that adhere to these learned principles. The most common types of generative models used are:\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consist of two neural networks – a generator that creates new molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish real molecules from generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating realistic and potentially useful molecules.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecular data. They can then sample from this latent space and decode it to generate new molecular structures.\n*   **Transformer Models (similar to those used in language):** These are increasingly being adapted for molecular generation, treating chemical structures as sequences of atoms and bonds. They can capture complex long-range dependencies in molecular structures.\n\n**Key Capabilities and Innovations:**\n\n1.  **Generating Novel Chemical Space:** AI can explore chemical possibilities far beyond what human intuition or existing libraries might suggest. This opens up entirely new avenues for drug discovery.\n2.  **Multi-Objective Optimization:** A single AI model can be trained to simultaneously optimize for multiple properties. For example, it can design a molecule that:\n    *   Binds strongly to a specific disease target.\n    *   Has good solubility and permeability.\n    *   Minimizes potential off-target interactions (reducing side effects).\n    *   Is synthetically feasible to produce.\n3.  **Accelerated Design Cycles:** Instead of months or years of trial-and-error synthesis and testing, AI can propose candidate molecules in hours or days. This drastically speeds up the early stages of discovery.\n4.  **\"Dreaming\" Up Drugs for Difficult Targets:** For targets that have been notoriously hard to drug with traditional methods, AI's ability to explore novel chemical scaffolds can be revolutionary.\n\n**Why is This a Big Deal?**\n\n*   **Breaking Through Limitations:** Many diseases are caused by complex biological mechanisms, and finding molecules that can effectively interact with the relevant targets is incredibly challenging. AI's de novo design capabilities offer a way to overcome these limitations.\n*   **Efficiency and Cost Reduction:** By rapidly generating and pre-screening promising candidates, AI reduces the number of molecules that need to be synthesized and tested experimentally, saving significant time and money.\n*   **Personalized Medicine Potential:** In the future, AI could potentially design bespoke molecules tailored to an individual patient's genetic makeup or specific disease subtype.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\n*   **Experimental Validation is Still King:** AI designs are predictions. They *must* be validated through rigorous laboratory experiments (synthesis, binding assays, cell-based assays, animal studies).\n*   **Synthesizability:** While AI can propose molecules, ensuring they can be practically and affordably synthesized in a lab is a crucial step. Progress is being made in incorporating synthesizability scores into the AI models.\n*   **Understanding the \"Why\":** While AI can generate effective molecules, fully understanding the detailed mechanism of action or the precise reasons why a molecule works can still be a research effort.\n\nIn essence, de novo drug design powered by AI represents a paradigm shift from *finding* drugs to *inventing* them, opening up a vast new frontier in medicinal chemistry and therapeutic innovation.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several companies, ranging from well-funded startups to established pharmaceutical giants, are heavily invested in AI-driven de novo drug design.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
